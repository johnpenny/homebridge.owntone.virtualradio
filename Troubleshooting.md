# Troubleshooting

- Keep in mind that the speaker names visible in some HomeKit views may not be their full exact name, due to room prefix hiding, use the output reporting feature in this plugin to print the full exact names in the Homebridge log
- If you have tagged more tracks and wish to generate those switches, you must restart Homebridge
- You may tweak the switch names in HomeKit if you have any issues with Siri, but any changes to the tracks or radio names will revert your changes
- If you change any output names in HomeKit, they will no longer be linked to your virtual radio until you also change them in the plugin settings
- To hide station buttons in HomeKit, go into their settings and switch off 'Add to home view'
